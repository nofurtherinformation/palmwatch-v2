    "The Hershey Company is headquartered in the United States in Hershey, Pennsylvania and was founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey. Hershey is the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America and a global leader in chocolate and sugar confectionery. We market confectionery products in over 50 countries worldwide, employ more than 12,000 people and have revenues of more than $ 5 billion per year. Our mission is to bring sweet moments of Hershey happiness to the world every day. We do this through our values of being open to possibilities, making a difference, growing together and being one Hershey. This mission and these values are at the core of our work in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). We are building on Milton Hershey's legacy of commitment to consumers, community and children, by providing high-quality Hershey products while conducting our business in a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner. We have organized CSR-related business issues in four areas: environment, community, workplace and marketplace. In each area, we have defined priority statements and measurable targets. Our programs, priorities and targets are found in our CSR Report: www.thehersheycompany.com/social-responsibility/csr-report We will provide updates on our progress in future scorecard updates and CSR Reports. Regarding the Environment, we have identified sustainable sourcing as a priority. We seek to better understand the impacts of our current inputs and to learn how we can meet product requirements with more sustainable sourcing.",
